# Twitter Feed Analysis for Lok Sabha Elections
Twitter Feeds were analysed during the Lok Sabha Elections 2019 to guage the overall popularities of each party and predict the winner based solely on the tweets made by the population. This was made as a part of ourNLP Course at COEP University.

We attempted to find out whether people accurately post about their political preferences on the social media platform and used people's sentiment and moods, along with a general sense of tweet popularity to figure out how much a tweet could mean in terms of a vote for a particular party.

We achieved fairly successful results and our plots even showed a highly accurate popularity trend across each state. The project is still being worked on and improvements can be expected in the future.
